### 1. Background Information
RMS *Titanic* was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.

### 2. Dataset
The dataset contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2,224 passengers and crew on board the *Titanic*. 

*[The dataset can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)*

#### Variable description
* **Survived**: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* **Sex**: Gender of the passengers
* **Age**: Age of years
* **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the *Titanic*
* **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the *Titanic*
* **Ticket**: Ticket number
* **Fare**: Passenger fare
* **Cabin**: Cabin number
* **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

*Note: Pclass is a  proxy for socio-economic status (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower).*

### 3. Questions for Investigation
Although there were some elements of luck involved in surviving the sinking, it is highly possible that some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. The questions raised for this investigation are:
* Was social status a factor in survival? (Were upper-class passengers more likely to survive?)
* Did women and children have a better chance to survive?
* What was the age distribution in survival?
* Did passengers by themselves or with their families aboard tend to survive?
